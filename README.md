# SacCodeRack

Hello to anyone reading this!

The purpose of this repos is to save portions of my various code projects to both act as a highlight reel as well as backup.

These portions of code are meant only to demonstrate various fundamentals and are not meant as an end all. If you have suggestions
for modifications, I love to learn new ways for efficiency and ability!
